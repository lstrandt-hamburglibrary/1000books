   - Changed starting Y position from 200 to 150
   - Made boundaries consistent for touch and keyboard controls

### 5. **Sliding Puzzle Complete Rebuild** (v3.9.6 - v3.9.8)
   - **Initial Problem**: User wanted one large image broken into 8 tiles
   - **Failed Attempts**:
     - Tried using Unsplash API for real animal images (didn't work)
     - Tried Picsum service for random images (didn't work)
     - Created SVG pattern images (didn't display properly)
   - **Final Solution**:
     - Completely removed old sliding puzzle code
     - Built new simple implementation using emoji animals
     - Created 3x3 grid with visual differentiation
     - Used opacity and color variations instead of image slicing

### 6. **Keyboard Shortcut Fixes** (v3.9.9 - v3.9.11)
   - **Original Issue**: Ctrl+Shift+G wasn't working as documented
   - **First Fix**: Made shortcut accept both uppercase and lowercase 'G'
   - **Second Issue**: Ctrl+Shift+G opened browser find window
   - **Second Fix**: Changed shortcut to Ctrl+Alt+T
   - **Third Issue**: Ctrl+Alt+T wasn't triggering
   - **Final Fix**: Moved event listener inside DOMContentLoaded block for proper initialization
   - **Documentation Update**: Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect new shortcut
